Problem 1:
The algorithm finds the square root of the given number. It keeps dividing the upper limit +lower limit //2
till the time the the product of the above operation is equal to the number or lower limit == upper limit -1 condition is met.

Time complexity :
since we are always dividing the UL + Lower limit by 2 the time complexity is O(logn)

Space complexity :
O(1)
