Problem 6:
get min max problem traverse the array and updates min and max variable based on the following conditions:

if new number is < min min == to new number else don’t update the min if new number is >
max max = new number else don’t update the max. after the traversal the min and max
variable holds the min and max of array.

Time Complexity:
O(n)

Space Complexity:
O(1)
